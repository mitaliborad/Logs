2025-03-28 11:27:47,996 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: If you want to create unlimited videos for social media without showing your face, follow this step-by-step method:



1. Choose an Underrated Niche
Before you start, find a niche with low competition but high viral potential. To do this:

- Go to Google Trends and search for trending topics.
- Search on YouTube to see if there are already many videos on the topic. If not, it might be a great opportunity.
- Check trending videos on TikTok and Instagram Reels to find high-engagement content.



2. Download High-Performing Videos in the Niche
Once you find a promising niche, download popular videos for analysis:

- Use sites like SnapTik, SSYouTube, SaveFrom.net, Y2Mate, etc.
- Download short videos (under 2 minutes) with high retention rates.



3. Transcribe the Videos
To understand their structure, transcribe the videos using tools like:

- Otter AI
- Sonix AI
- Transkriptor
- CapCut (auto subtitles feature)



4. Generate a Better Script with ChatGPT
Now that you have the transcription, paste the text into ChatGPT and ask:

> "Rewrite this script in a more engaging and dynamic way while keeping the same idea but making it even better."

Make manual adjustments if necessary to ensure it sounds natural and well-structured.



5. Create a Digital Avatar (Faceless)
To generate a unique digital face, use Ideogram AI with a prompt like:

> "Create a realistic avatar of a young motivational speaker with a neutral background."

Download the generated image.



6. Animate the Avatar with AI
Now, use the Dream Face app to bring your avatar to life:

1. Select "Image to Video".
2. Upload your avatar image.
3. Choose a natural facial movement style.



7. Add a Natural AI Voice Over
To generate a professional voiceover, use one of these tools:
- Dream Face
- ElevenLabs
- PlayHT
- Speechify

Copy and paste your script into the text-to-speech tool and download the generated audio.



8. Edit and Assemble the Final Video using CapCut, Adobe Premiere Rush, or any other video editor:

1. Import the animated avatar video from Dream Face.
2. Enable auto subtitles for better engagement.
3. Export the video in vertical format (1080x1920) for TikTok and Reels, or horizontal (1920x1080) for YouTube.



9. Publish and Repeat the Process
Now upload your video to YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels, and repeat the process to create unlimited content!

This method allows you to create engaging videos without showing your face while taking advantage of viral trends.
