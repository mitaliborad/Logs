I need to decode a file encrypted by ioncube loader, I'm Brazilian and subscribing to https://easytoyou.eu/, which seems like the best option, is difficult when converting the value to my currency.

The PHP version from file is 7.2.
Does anyone know any other way or can help me?

Thank you in advance
