2025-03-28 10:44:37,146 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello everyone,

I hope to post in the right thread.

I recently changed hosting and transfer the domain from siteground to ultrahost (a month ago). Now I just find out that my domain is DBL listing (also outgoing email are not working) and the IP is CSS Blocklist.

The website is 5 years old and is keep on growing.

Is there a way to find out if the IP they gave me was already in the blacklist?

Any suggestion on how to get out from the blacklist? Cause spamhaus is keep replying to the ticket with the same message:

Thank you for contacting Spamhaus DBL Removals,The DBL listing for ***. com is not eligible for removal at this time. We do not reveal specific factors for inclusion in the DBL as it includes many criteria.The factors which affect this domain's reputation may also change over time, so by engaging in good reputation practices it will drop out of the DBL.For more information, please see the following FAQs:https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/Spamhaus DBL#371For help with good reputation practices for marketing email, this FAQcan be helpful: https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/Marketing FAQsDBL listings expire a few days after last detection. You can always open a ticket (or update this one) to inform us when the situation has been resolved.

How can I know what to fix? Is there anyone that found yourself in the same situation and got out of it?

Thanks a lot as always,
Andrea
