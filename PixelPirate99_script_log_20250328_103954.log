Well, It's the worst SMM Panel Ever!, It gave me Bots, Bot Subscribers, Bot Viewers and Bots that don't even understand the language of the video and yet they subscribed!.

It's such a shame that "A large corporation company would hire or run the worst SMM panel behind the curtain. literally. Lmfao.

On the other hand, Facebook does the business of advertising very very well, Even Tiktok has somewhat better advertising than big G in this regard of Social Media.

Just a heads up For Users who might want to use promote in the future. Your channel will die right after you use it, Pls don't .
