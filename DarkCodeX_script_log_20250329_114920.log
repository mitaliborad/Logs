2025-03-29 11:53:15,515 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hey guys,

There's been a lot of buzz about whether Reddit SEO still delivers results in 2025, and I'm here to tell you - it's very much alive and thriving!

Despite the endless algorithm tweaks and tighter moderation, Reddit remains a goldmine for organic traffic, backlink building, and targeted lead generation. Here's what's currently working:
Aged Accounts: Reddit continues to favour established, high-karma accounts. Spend some time nurturing accounts with authentic engagement before dropping links.
Accounts With Karma: It's very important that accounts have karma because you won't be able to post something on good-establishes subreddits. Of course, you can grow karma on your own.
Niche Subreddits: Smaller communities provide massive SEO benefits. Posting valuable content and subtly embedding your links can skyrocket your traffic with minimal competition.
Keyword Optimization: Reddit's content is still indexed heavily by Google. Optimize your post titles and content strategically - long-tail keywords perform exceptionally well.
Engagement Boosting: Immediate engagement (comments, upvotes) signals relevancy to both Reddit and Google, amplifying your SEO power. Networks and engagement pods can still give you an edge.
I'm currently working with a couple of clients on Reddit SEO, and I will keep you updated.

What's your experience with Reddit SEO in 2025?

Cheers!
