2025-03-28 10:21:42,235 - DEBUG - Attempting to locate main post element with locator: ('xpath', '//div[@data-lb-id and contains(@data-lb-id, "post-")]')
2025-03-28 10:21:42,282 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I had 4 Instagram accounts on my rooted Note 9 I had Spectrum Internet, I later deleted 4 accounts and keeping 2. After creating another account via custom ROM on my Note 9 the account was suspended, I stopped. On Nov 2024, I already switched ISP Frontier Internet and I brought the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I made a new Gmail and Instagram account with Frontier WiFi, but it was suspended. Despite appealing, the app claimed "WIFI issues" during verification, though my connection was fine.

So I used a aged Gmail account and used mobile data US Mobile to sign up and I was able to make a new Instagram account. I was busy with life and I did view a few reels, but I it left sitting there and when I used Instagram I used mobile data and not wifi.

So recently I decided to use WIFI instead and I started reposting videos from TikTok each time I would download a video I would delete the metadata with adarsus.com. I would use capcut mobile to edit the videos. I have 17 posts the views are 0, 21, 9, 30, 5, 123, 6, 108, 27, 171, 253, 214, 157, 247, 168, 156, 44 views.

Is my account shadow banned or something, I seen a lot of crazy videos that get thousands or millions of views on the explore page. Is it because when I made the account I got suspended and I made a new account using mobile data and then used WIFI? I even followed 20 people on my niche one day and few days later followed other accounts in total I have 39 following and only 3 followers. I'm dropshipping.

My other question if I buy a aged instagram account from here on marketplace and use a aged Gmail account to replace the one the account comes with via wifi will it be the same thing?
I also brought a new phone the Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 5G and will come in a few days. Should I sign up using a aged gmail account when signing to instagram using wifi or should I buy a aged instagram from marketplace and use that?
