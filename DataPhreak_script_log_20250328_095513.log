2025-03-28 09:59:23,823 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I work with an OnlyFans model, and her engagement on TikTok lives is great, consistently hitting 5k views throughout the live, however on WeChat the engagement is terrible rarely hitting 100+ views with poor conversion, does it pick up the more you use it? Can anyone direct me to information that would be useful to read? I don’t feel that she is the issue or her content, and it would be great to utilise another platform for growth,

Thanks for reading!
