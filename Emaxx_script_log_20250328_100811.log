I recently received 80 phones as payment from a service provider, its a long story haha

I have tried selling a few and to be honest have just got complaints and ridiculous offers for them so I'd like to do a project with them.

How would I use these to make money? I know a little bit of coding and quite a bit of SEO and did some research into click farms and selling high-quality traffic.

Does anyone have any experience with this?


I also live in South Africa so labour costs are relatively cheaper
