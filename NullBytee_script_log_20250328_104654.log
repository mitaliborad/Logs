2025-03-28 10:49:23,903 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi, I'm just starting on making my own X account. The account itself is already blue checked verified and was on since October 2023. I've been doing lots of post, 12 post a day. But I still didn't get the result I wanted, I only got 50 followers. And for you who's asking what Cluster am I on, I want to be a memecoin Shiller, not the Dev, more like the ones who promote it.

I've searched on the internet, it seems like X algorithm is to make the user scroll and stay as long as possible because they make revenue from the ads.

I've learnt some things in X also, also the recent changes on it where Replies will boost a post more than a retweet, I also learnt that by engaging with an influencer, my post will be able to get to their audience if they follow me. And lastly, I also researched that X algorithm will make a prediction on how engaging a content would be ( especially on entertainments ) ranking it and putting it on the user's for you page.

However, I couldn't shake off this weird feeling. I don't think that's all it takes, it's more like a community carried social media. By that I meant only if you have connections with big influencers constantly then you can be popular. Or.. even worse, one person has multiple large influencers account on the same cluster, boosting one another account, since usually a tweet getting raid replied within the hour of the tweet was posted, will explode, especially if it's replied by blue-checked ones.

I've saw that most of the large influencers in my cluster (shilling memecoins cluster(not actually putting any money on it)) has their account since 2018-2020, but they have more than 40k-120k+ post. Only some have below 20k, but never lower than 15k

Imagine posting 12 times a day (2 post per hour) to even reach 60k it would take one almost 14 years of posting consistently non-stop. Especially I heard that there's a new algo that prevents the same user from looking at their small influencer (like me) posts multiple times in a row.

So whats y'all opinion? Am I on the right track based on your guys experience. Or is there any tips or any secret behind those big influencers, if there's a big influencer here. Which I believe yes there is. Any tips will help lmao
