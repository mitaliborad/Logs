2025-03-29 11:39:30,210 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Based on the long-term operations of a large number of my customers, PayPal remains the best payment solution for IPTV.

IPTV payments must utilize a combination of stealth PayPal accounts and a cloaker methods. Due to PayPal's strict risk control measures, a stealth accounts will inevitably get shut down over time. Therefore, a large number of accounts are required to sustain operations.

When the daily transaction volume exceeds a certain amount (e.g., over $3,000), a Paypal cloaker's rotation system becomes necessary. This requires a large number of PayPal stealth accounts, which is something most IPTV resellers find difficult to manage. It is best to delegate this task to a professional third-party.

This is my experience. Do you have any good suggestion?
