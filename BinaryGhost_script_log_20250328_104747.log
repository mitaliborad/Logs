2025-03-28 10:52:25,723 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello fellows,
I have a website that offers ad banners that admins are allowed to ad manually and soon hopefully I will be able to put google adsense.
However, I am planning to allow user accounts to pay for ad positions in their user panel depending on the ad positions and period of subscription, it's cost will be calculated. Including crypto payments and debit cards, eventually if it's possible to create that somewhere in user account panel.
Is it possible to make that possible with a plugin or other shortcode with a script?
Is anybody doing that already and share experience with a tool or a plugin, maybe a script or something else.
I will be happy to hear.
Sincerely,
