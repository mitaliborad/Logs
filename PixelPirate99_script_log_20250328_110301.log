Now, when I'm using an anti detect browser with paid Proxy IPs, I get the 'You have been blocked due to network policy' message on Reddit. It then prompts me to sign up, after which I can access Reddit.

Does this mean they know I'm using a proxy or do they know accounts from my actual IP were permanent banned?
