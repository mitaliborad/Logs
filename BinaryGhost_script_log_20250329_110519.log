And I want the blog article to disappear or just not be indexed anymore on google...or at least push that article down the rankings as much as possible

How would you go about it? Are there tools here that can do it? I am currently looking for one and have one tool, that helps with removing the article from google and pushing it down the SERPs basically on a button push..

but I am open to test at least three or four of them
