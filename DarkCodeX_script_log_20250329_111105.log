2025-03-29 11:15:20,328 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi everyone,

After spending about 90 days figuring things out and getting burned by numerous "developers", last year I finally finished an amazing tool that stacks AI on top of AI be able to generate personalized cold emails at scale.

I used Clay in the past but it was super expensive for what I needed (volume) so this forced me to develop my own.

The result? I am now able to enter thousands of leads from Apollo/Instantly into a google sheet and have it scrape the leads website and make the emails sound like a human wrote it.

I have 2 clients in the finance industry that lend money to other businesses but no matter how hard you try, the business either needs money or they don't.

We charge by the number of appointments we're able to generate. The numbers aren't impressive but I don't think it's the tool's fault.

Here's my question: I am looking for a "starving crowd" as Hormozi puts it. This is who GPT thinks I should be targeting with this tool:


B2B Sales Agencies & SDR Teams (Outsourced Sales)

Business Loan Brokers & Alternative Lenders

Recruiting & Headhunting Firms

M&A Firms & Business Brokers

High-Ticket Consulting & Coaching Programs ($5K-$100K Offers)

Agencies Selling High-Ticket B2B Services (SEO, PPC, Web Dev, Branding)

My 2 clients are in the finance side of lending money as mentioned and I don't think more clever copy would make someone want to borrow huge sums of money.

Any other ideas? I was also thinking of licensing it out for say $1k/month + they pay all others fees associated with it.

If you have any ideas on this, would love to hear it!
