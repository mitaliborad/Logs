2025-03-29 12:24:17,512 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hey everyone!

The last few weeks i noticed that Linkedin has become very strict against Fake accounts. Are there any best practices to prevent Linkedin from detecting?

I have a few accounts for automation, but last few days linkedin bans my accounts for no reason.

Beste practices questions:
- Which type of proxy is recommended?
- Which type of linkedin accounts should i buy?
- I am already using a multibrowser app.

Please help out a newbie!
