My competitor uses one of the cloaca varieties. He is able to hide his site from certain ip or fingerprint diapasons.
Only real users with real ip and fingerprints can access the site. You can't access the site from virtual servers, even if they appear to be human, you can't access it from the ip of government services, you can't access it from all the ip's I bought.
Who knows how he was able to do this? I can't post the site here as it would violate the rules, sorry for this inconvenience....
