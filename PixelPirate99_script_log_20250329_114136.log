2025-03-29 11:44:25,516 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: First of all, greetings. I know that many people trying to run ads on Twitter are getting banned—I’m in the same situation. That’s why I’m sharing all the methods I’ve tested in detail.

Methods I’ve Tested and Results
1. Trying with My Own IP and VPN
I purchased an old Twitter account, logged in with a clean IP without using a VPN, and got banned. Then I tried using a VPN, and I got banned again.

2. Proxy and Anti-Detect Browser Usage
I tested anti-detect browsers like GoLogin, MultiBrowser, and AdsPower. The best results came from GoLogin (Dolphin is also quite good).
For proxies, I purchased from SmartProxy, and so far, it has provided the best performance.

However, there is a major issue: Since Stripe is banned on Twitter, you need identity verification to make payments. Even MEXC and KuCoin don’t require KYC, but Twitter does. That’s why I’m searching for a better proxy provider.

3. Logging in with Auth_Token and CT0
I used this method to get a blue checkmark, but I still got banned. Now, I don’t change anything in the accounts I purchase.
Logging in with Auth_Token and CT0 immediately suspends the account, so I first log in with a username and password and warm up the account using cookies.

My Current Test Process: Trying Mobile Proxy
I’ve decided to test mobile proxies. Here’s the method I’ll be following:

Buy an old account
Log in with the username and password
Use a proxy matching the account’s original location
After logging in, extract cookies after 3-5 hours
Warm up the account for 1-2 days with the proxy
Get a blue checkmark and test running ads
During this process, it’s crucial to avoid bot-like actions. Sudden follows, sending DMs, or making rapid changes can trigger Twitter’s security systems and put your account at risk.

Payments and Financial Transactions
I use American Express and premium cards.
For billing addresses, I use the country where the account was originally created.
I make ad payments using my personal credit cards and virtual cards.
Some card providers automatically block Twitter payments, so I make sure to use internationally accepted cards.
Important Note
You must use an anti-detect browser, or you’ll get banned due to fingerprint tracking.
Twitter uses browser fingerprinting to detect and link accounts. GoLogin, MultiBrowser, or Dolphin can help minimize this risk.

Final Thoughts & Community Support
If I’ve missed anything or if you have any questions, feel free to ask—this is a support group!

So far, I’m warming up 30 accounts and planning to scale up to 100 accounts daily. I’m testing every possible method, and I will run that ad no matter what!

Also, I’m open to proxy recommendations. If you have any better options, feel free to share!


Thank you vlad_x
